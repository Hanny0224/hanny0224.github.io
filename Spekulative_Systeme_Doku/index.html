                is a workpiece that implies how people perceives the aging of women and men differently. While aging for women is often associated with “expiration,” men are often seen as becoming more attractive and successful. The hourglass-shaped Coca-Cola glass represents women, symbolizing the idea that women are seen as "sexy" with this body shape, yet their time is running out like the sands in the glass. In contrast, men are represented by a rectangular-shaped Coca-Cola glass, indicating that men's time is more consistent and less likely to run out.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the representative glass bottles, actual proofs were also given to the audience visually and auditorily. 
                Visitors could see and hear how the society comment women and men differently through real comment screenshots and interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, me being as a women and one of the artists, I feel very sad and resentful. I’m sad, because of the fact that I, too, will be “expired” one day. And resentful, because more than half of the critical comments came from women themselves. As an aging women, there really is nothing we could do other than buying more cosmetic products to treat ourselves. (So please stop saying that women loves to spend money!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, our teamwork was exceptional, filled with creativity and thoughtful discussions. I’m proud that every detail of this project carries meaning, and we were all deeply dedicated in the making of Bottom’s Up Time’s Up.

                    As I walked through the exhibition “Expired (Abgelaufen) & Repetitive”, the workpiece of worn shoes with pinned nails caught my attention. Resting atop the display, a pair of worn Converse Chucks clung to each other through their tangled laces. One shoe was pinned flat to the table's surface with long thick nails, while the other was hanging by the side. Viewers were invited to engage with this creation by hammering additional nails, becoming part of its ongoing story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the setup of this display, it seemed to convey a message: despite the sensation of every step in Chucks feeling like nails pressing into your feet, one is still going to wear them daily until they're worn out. Some viewers also interpreted this workpiece as a symbol of "etwas an den Nagel hängen, weil es abgelaufen ist."
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the interactive aspect of this workpiece encouraging participation and exploration, the occasional pounding noises were unsettling and irritating,  disturbing the other visitors from observing other workpieces and disrupting the overall ambiance of the exhibition. Moreover, while the concept of "etwas an den Nagel hängen" was hinted, the pair of shoes wasn't displayed as if hung on a nail but rather nailed to the table. The shoe that has been hanging by the table also doesn’t seem to be “an den Nagel hängen”, as in to give up, as it appeared to still be “hang’in there!” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unquestionably, the theme of “Abgelaufen” was effectively conveyed through the imagery of the worn shoes. Yet, the messages beyond “ein Paar abgelaufene Schuhe” aren't quite coming across as clearly as they could. While workpieces are expressions of individual perspectives, it is essential for them to align with the messages they intend to convey, providing deeper connections and insights into the theme and with the visitors.

                The original concept for the Souvenir Booth was a very simple idea: A souvenir for this exhibition that visitors could make memories and bring back home. The best souvenir would of course require visitors’ participation, adding another layer of meaning and memory. The masks of body parts were originally made to indicate the high beauty standards of this society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating this project was incredibly enjoyable. Both Kati and Greta agreed to my idea so fast and and we finalized all the details in just 15 minutes. We also had a great teamwork while making the masks. During the exhibition, I personally felt like I was the one who was making great memories for myself with all the cute pictures that we’ve taken. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The only negative feedback we received was that some visitors might feel shy about taking photos in front of everyone. Kati and I took in the feedback and tried our best to solve this concern. However, after spending 2 weeks of searching, we really couldn’t find anything that resembles a tent or a coverage. At the same time, I also worried that covering the project might diminish its fun and appeal. I believe it is after seeing the happiness of other visitors taking pictures that attracts more people over. In the end, we decided to keep the booth open and it turned out perfectly. After seeing all the pictures and the smiles on everyones’ faces, we were both beyond happy!

                    BABIES AS SOUVENIRS?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Created by Fleur Schäfer and Jill Gaertner in the exhibition of Souvenir & Participatory, “Maybe Baby” is a small and unassuming piece of work, yet rich in discussions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the middle of the exhibition, an unopened condom with pink bubble letters saying "Top Secret" lay restlessly on a small table, where lights were barely casting. A pile of map pins with initially red and white heads was stabbed into the condom, creating a hedgehog-like form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the name “Maybe Baby” suggested, the workpiece seemed to portray the uncertainties of potential pregnancy even with the use of protection. Pink bubble letters on the packaging seemed to deliver an atmosphere of lively, energetic happiness. However, the unsettling feature of map pins stabbed into the condom created a sense of anxiety and disconcerting annoyance. The workpiece hinted that while the action of using a condom may symbolize a soft, sweet, happy moment, the harsh reality often hits hard and bursts the pink bubble of fantasy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Could this piece of work have another deeper meaning? While visitors were welcome to engage with “Maybe Baby” by adding additional pins of various colors into the condom, the initial colors of the pins were as simple as red and white, similar to those used on maps. Could this feature be interpreted as a message suggesting that couples who travel extensively, rather than collecting magnets and postcards, may unintentionally create babies as their souvenirs to bring home?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In its simplicity, "Maybe Baby" carries deep significant meanings surrounding intimacy, illusion, reality, and traveling with just two simple items. Humorously resonating with unexpected souvenirs of life that accompany us on our journeys.

                        At first, the rumor “Gregor has 6 toes” was just an example  while discussing our project. But we decided to use it as one of our real rumors.

                Spreading these little rumors and lying to everyone has left me with a significant sense of guilt. Never was I, or I believe most of the people in the classroom have ever been in a situation where we were "required and forced" to tell lies. I don’t even remember how we came up with this idea.  It also brought us a lot of pressure that we had to spread the rumors quickly and discreetly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still remember the class before the exhibition, where I had to figure out how to share the rumors efficiently, knowing we wouldn’t meet again before the event. My heart was racing so fast that I could hear my own heartbeat in the class. I am still very proud of myself that I thought of a great way to (lie) tell everyone that one of the sewing machines from fashion design was stolen.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I wasn’t entirely satisfied with how we presented the project. To improve it, I believe we should have used a newspaper that actually indicated Lügenpresse. My original suggestion was to actually print out a stack of papers featuring various false news. The audience could interact with the workpiece by stamping “Lies” onto them. Some of the papers would then reveal that we were behind the three fake rumors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the guilt and the trust we have lost with our friends and classmates, the project was incredibly fun and exciting.  I believe we’ve created a memorable experience that we’ll all remember after 10 years or more!

                Another fun fact for this project was that this idea was made up while I volunteered to leave and buy a cup of coffee for Jil. I didn’t know how Nikolas and Jil came up with this concept, but as I sat down, they informed me that we would be creating a fake persona and convincing the entire school that this person was real! I was initially shocked and hoped they were joking. The thought of creating and managing a fake social media account in and for just one month felt overwhelming. However, both Nikolas and Jil were enthusiastic about it, I couldn’t say no. Luckily, Jil had an old account for her pet dog and we only had to change the name and hide the pictures that had her face on it. Given that we had already lost some trust last time, we decided to keep quiet this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Excitements went throughout the entire process starting when we were sticking up the flyers at 10 pm at the campus. Most of the teachers and students were already gone except for our own professors. We had to sneak around the campus, hoping Gregor wouldn’t find us suspicious and see through our plan.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Later that week, Philppa showed me a picture of the flyers “we” stuck on and said, “Look, Fleur and I saw this yesterday. We thought it was so funny.” My heart thumped and tried to reply as casually as possible, “Oh, Ha Ha. She seems desperate.” and immediately texted Nikolas and Jil. I also noticed a few of my friends actually reached out to Inès Roger and followed her. The experience was a mix of excitement and guilt. While posting our last flyer for meeting Inès Roger, I really hoped that none of the people I know would come.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understood that lying to people is a really bad thing to do and were concerned it might be too serious for some. Therefore, I created a new video and posted it on Inès Roger’s Intragram for her “fans” that didn’t come to the exhibition to see the reveal. I hope no trouble was caused and that I will never have to tell big lies again.

                    “The Message” by Fleur Schäfer and Isah Hoffman featured a bold and courageous performance workpiece in the exhibition “Lügenpresse: Fake it till you make it”. Outside a room cast in bright red lights, Isah Hoffman portrayed a businessman standing at the entrance, welcomed each audience individually after they paid a 1-euro entrance fee and received a black crayon. From the outside, the entire setup looked like an attracting circus, with walls and boards covering the entire performance space. Only glimpses of red light beamed through the door frame, perking people’s curiosity and excitement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But this excitement soon turned into shock and surprisement. With the black crayon in hand, visitors entered the room to find a woman, portrayed by Fleur Schäfer, sitting on a small stool, fully naked with her back turned and her hands tied with thick rope. Her body was covered with insulting words such as "Whore," "Slut," and "Bitch." Positioned in front of the woman was a mirror, reflecting her front while covering only her most intimate parts. With a blank, emotionless expression, she sat quietly as the businessman invited the audience to write one word per payment on her body. Her face was as if telling us that this is her normal life and she is used to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The Message” effectively showcased capitalism by highlighting that businesses often consider profits over ethical, unconcerned of whether someone gets hurt in the process. During the exhibition, it was easy to realise how people are willing to buy anything to fulfil their curiosity, even when they know what to expect. Additionally, the workpiece also performed the contrast between genders, illustrating how men can easily earn money while fully clothed in a suit, whereas women are often viewed as toys, dolls, or products valued by their ability to generate profit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite being the only workpiece that required payment and many restrictions, all of the audience was still very willing to “pay” a visit. However, the theme “Lügenpresse” seems to be lost in this workpiece,  as there were no lies or false informations indicated. The message they conveyed was sadly a truthful reflection of our society today.

                    I found this semester truly fascinating; it was fun, exciting, and full of surprises. I especially love how Gregor is always very supportive of what we want to do. I recall that during almost every group discussion, when we were uncertain about something, one of us would definitely say, “We will discuss this with Gregor; he will have an idea,” or “Oh! Gregor will love this idea!” I find this reliance, closeness, and trust with a professor really touching and fascinating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several activities in the class also stood out to me, such as the debate on which artwork should be displayed in the exhibition space and the innovative way of voting for the new Lügenpresse topic. These experiences were very interesting and unexpected. I even took pictures and videos of these sessions to share with my mom. This lecture felt more like a fun camp than a serious Master's theory class. At the same time, not only did I learn to capture and emphasize the uniqueness of everyone’s ideas, I also learned to think critically, and bravely share my opinions. It was also a privilege to work with classmates who were equally devoted to our projects and full of creativity and amazing ideas.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although it makes me sad to think that this is my last lecture at the university and I will no longer have classes, this seminar was the best way to end my university experience. We had fun together, created a bunch of interesting and cool works, and made great memories together. I couldn't have asked for a better ending to my study journey.
